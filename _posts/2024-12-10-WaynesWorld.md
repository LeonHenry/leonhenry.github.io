Have I shown you my proudest achievement?

Wayne’s World is one of my favorite movies of all time. When I was in 5th grade I watched it to the point of complete memorization and had aspirations to film a shot by shot remake (a script, cast and costumes materialized but actual filming never did). It was one of the first movies I ever fell in love with. Even after seeing it so much I can put it on and still enjoy every second of it. Still, Wayne’s World presents a riddle to the observers new and old and that is: What the hell is the deal with Mike Meyer’s face? It was always funny and now its my favorite thing about the movie. This supercut is the authoritative collection of every scene in Wayne’s World 1 and 2 where Wayne silently makes a face at the camera. These pauses are most often silent and sometimes break the fourth wall (and always funny) . Its a master stroke by Mike Meyers but I guess its just part of Wayne’s personality? Like what is it? Is it a nervous tick? Is it the opposite of that, like he’s so chilled out that he’s literally chilling out at the end of his sentences? Is it an acknowledgment towards us watching him? What the hell is it!? Its just a silly goofy thing that totally rules so I made an ode to it.

I forgot I made this 5 years ago and I am so happy I did.

Email me with your theories as to what Wayne is doing.
