He looked at her and she looked at him and it was simple. There was something to it, sure. Something mysterious and wanting. Something underneath their retinas, the perfectly crimped hair, the layers of shirts and sweaters. Something underneath that they both wanted to discover, like a pile of leaves begging to be jumped into. Was it soft and inviting? Or hiding something jagged and sinister? Neither knew yet. In that way, it was all simple. They were both old enough to know it and so they looked at each other, savoring.

What was it to know the story of someone? He was sure that she was exactly as he had dreamed up. Misunderstood. Working to pay the bills so that she could pursue her true passion. What that was, he didn’t know yet.

And she had her own story. That he was the type of man she dreamed of or at least, he was what she could dream up at this point in her life. There - present. A rock. Also working at the windowless grocery store they had met at to pursue his real passion. One that would surely pay the bills. What that was, she didn’t know yet.

And this simplicity was so beautiful to them, so perfect, that for the first three quarters of dinner they had a hard time even threatening the serenity of them being together at first.

That was, of course, before the third neat scotch and before he opened his dumb mouth.

“Your hair” he paused “it always rests so perfectly…” silence “…on your head.” As stupid as it sounds, it made complete sense in the sterility of their bullshit conversation. It was the wrench in the spoke of their conversation, but it broke the monotony. What he meant to say between those six evenly spaced periods was that she really did look good, always.

She immediately turned red which admittedly (unfortunately), fit exactly into the boy’s vision of her. Shy. Easily embarrassed. Humble. It had so much of an effect that he himself felt genius and even kind of powerful. It made him wonder why he worked that shitty job in the first place. Maybe he really could have done something better. He stopped at that, she was still red, and, while yes, shy, it wasn’t clear wether she was offended by the comment or what. He didn’t know what else to say! They had been talking about produce and the finer points of pineapple for so long that it felt appropriate to say something about how she looked tonight.

“Well I could return the compliment but you don’t have much to comment on in that regard.” He gave a hearty laugh. He was undeniably bald, and it was hilarious… Though he immediately felt that it made sense why he worked that shitty job.

But, he didn’t think he didn’t belong there, with her. And anyway, she said it nicely somehow. Somehow she understood.

Somehow, It had worked out.  They persevered through all that awkward stuff. The awkward eye contact, the strained conversations of wanting to ask questions but not wanting to get too close, the impossible balance of seeming interested while also aloof. It survived. They survived their attempt at sabotage together and somehow they were in love. Though it was familiar. Actually, it was just exactly like the beginning to her other love and maybe the love before that, if she could be sure that that too was love. She had felt these feelings before. Though it felt totally new, she was and had always been a careful thinker and it didn’t trick her now. She noticed the subtle similarities. She knew where it all could lead.

What was it really that brought them together? She thought, laying on his chest that night. He didn't smell all that good, she thought and while at the same time she wondered, why do things just work out sometimes?

Men were intimidated by her. She was 6’ 1” and never learned how to play the games that other girls her age seemed to master at an early age. Whether that was because of her height or her disposition or both, it eventually came to define her and it made dating a challenge. Not only were few men her size or bigger, but, they simply couldn’t contend in conversation with someone who didn’t laugh at their every word and who was unambiguous with hers. When things did work out, it was always, always, with older men. They didn’t care that she couldn’t play games nor did they care that she loved handling produce, visiting grocery stores, teaching gardening or hearing trumpet soloists in classical songs. They did like someone unwavering in their conversation and to them she wasn’t flakey or intimidating.  However, she was something to them- something alluring that she couldn’t put her finger on, coveted maybe, special even.

The longest relationship she had held after college was with a man in his mid 40s. They fucked for years. She had met him years before she moved to Manhattan and she continued to see him 11 months later when she moved back (and during holidays to see the family of course). On their fifth year of casual fucking it became clear that the both of them meant more to each other.

In 2012, work was hard to find in Portland, and she caught her lucky break at a grocery store as a cashier. They met when he came through her line and then made a not so frequent habit of it. They’d talk about whatever, she wasn’t even sure now, it must have looked like flirting. Eventually they became friends and eventually he was moving away. Farther out of town, where rent was cheaper and the grocery stores were too. On his last week in town, he bought a lottery ticket at her register and left it for her as a gift. He was going to the Skyline Tavern to meet his neighborhood friends, tie one on, and bring this chapter to a close. On a whim, after closing the store, she decided that she would go too.

The first time was just like the last. They would meet and talk about life for hours. And then fuck. It was the best sex she had had since being in love and second only to that. And then they’d talk about death for hours, falling in and out of sleep.

He made a living selling cologne and perfume on department store floors. He retired before that occupation stopped making sense. The south wall of his flat was filled entirely with glass bottles and fancy boxes of the finest fragrances. He always wore cologne and it stuck to her clothes. For that reason she would wear something nice for him when they’d meet up but not something too nice or that she’d plan on wearing anytime soon. Sometime in their relationship, after it had become clear that it was more than just fucking, though that was still all they did, he had her try on perfumes. They explored “woodsy” smells and “beachey smells” and really anything in a green or blue bottle. By the end of it, he gave her the one they liked most.  

It was different with him. It was so easy. They could just hang out and be themselves. There was no hot chemistry but there was everything else. Maybe everything else was more important?

She remembered having coffee with him- the rarest occasion since it didn’t involve fucking- and crying. Not in his arms but across the table from him. Not because she needed him or because she was lonely but because she couldn’t afford her latest rent increase and she simply didn’t want to leave. It didn’t bother him when women cried. Her sobs were deep but okay and it was okay because she could. Wasn’t that love? Wasn’t that more like it than having to be strong for someone else all the time? She didn’t know. She didn’t ask until now. In these late hours, at maybe the most wrong time. She wondered but she wasn’t sad.

He started saying weird things during sex like “all for you”, “this cock is yours” and her name always. And while she never confronted him, she simply stopped calling. No closure. Never needing it, either of them. Proving that weird something that the older men had for her.

And here she was, naked with a man who dressed just as nicely as she did. He was simple, she knew. And she was afraid that his simplicity meant that he did not run as deep in other ways. All she needed to do was shut her eyes. To let it go and let tomorrow come and let it maybe start over except this time from a starting point just a little farther ahead from the night previous, she could not.
